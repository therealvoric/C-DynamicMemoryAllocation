# c Dynamic Memory Allocation

This repository contains a C program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()` and freeing the allocated memory using `free()`. The program reserves memory for a single integer, assigns a value to it, and accesses the allocated memory.

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/therealvoric/C-DynamicMemoryAllocation.git


2. Compile the C program: gcc main.c -o dynamic_memory


3. Run the program: ./dynamic_memory


4. The program will reserve memory for a single integer, assign the value 42 to it, and print the value to the console: The Value is 42.


5. The program will then free the allocated memory.

For more details and explanations, refer to the comments in the source code.
